                <h2>this is me</h2>
                <p>rodrigo pimentel is a DREAMer and a beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. rodrigo grew up in East Providence, Rhode Island after coming to the United States at 10 months of age. They have rallied and organized Dreamers both in Rhode Island and Washington D.C. to push for a permanent fix for DACA recipients. As a writer, Rodrigo's commentary pertaining to immigration policy has been featured in Al Jazeera, The Guardian, and The Providence Journal.</p>
                    
                <p>locally, rodrigo lobbied the General Assembly and the Governor for legislation granting undocumented immigrants driver's licenses. In 2018, the state passed a law ensuring that DACA recipients would be issued driver's licenses regardless of future federal policy. Due to their work on the issue, Rodrigo was asked to introduce Governor Gina Raimondo at the bill signing. Rodrigo previously worked for the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University and currently attends the University of Rhode Island as a Data Science and Psychology Major.</p>
